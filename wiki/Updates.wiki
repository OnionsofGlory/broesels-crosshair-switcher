=Updates=

||==06/11/2011 - Version 2.3==||
||
- updated the “use tf_weapon_xx” aliases

- unified the class files:

	- changed the command to disable the crosshairswitcher

	- moved the specification of crosshairs for classes that the switcher is disabled for to settings.cfg (it will simply use the primary crosshair)

- massively cleaned up everything:

	- added shorten.cfg (explanation as to why is in the file itself)

	- added weapons.cfg to store the “use tf_weapons_xx” aliases

	- replaced all indents with spaces so it doesn’t look off in some editors

- updated the Readme file||

==06/10/2010 - Version 2.2==

- added the Polyount weapons to the tf_weapon_xx aliases

==16/08/2010 - Version 2.1==

The script now uses tf_weapon_xx AND the slot command. Thus previously experienced glitches (when switching weapons while taunting e.g.) won’t appear anymore, BUT the script needs to be updated when new weapons are added to the game. Otherwise it will function just fine, the glitches will then just appear with new weapons ;)

==06/11/2011 - Version 2.3==

	- updated the “use tf_weapon_xx” aliases

	- changed the command to disable the crosshairswitcher

	- moved the specification of crosshairs for classes that the switcher is disabled for to settings.cfg

	- added shorten.cfg (explanation as to why is in the file itself)

	- added weapons.cfg to store the "use tf_weapon_xx" aliases

	- replaced all indents with spaces so it doesn’t look off in some editors

	- updated the Readme file

==06/10/2010 - Version 2.2==

	- added the Polyount weapons to the "use tf_weapon_xx" aliases

==16/08/2010 - Version 2.1==

	- the script now uses "use tf_weapon_xx" in addition to the slot command. This fixes some glitches and adds the possibility of switching weapons while looking at the scoreboard, though the script now needs to be updated when new weapons are added to the game in order to be able to switch to these weapons while having the scoreboard open.
